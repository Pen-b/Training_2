# [0.1 Data Preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#preprocessing)

To change raw feature vectors into a representation that is more suitable for the downstream estimators.In general, learning algorithms benefit from standardization of the data set. If some outliers are present in the set, robust scalers or transformers are more appropriate. The behaviors of the different scalers, transformers, and normalizers on a dataset containing marginal outliers is highlighted in Compare the effect of different scalers on data with outliers.
